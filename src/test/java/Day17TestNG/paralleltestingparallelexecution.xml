<suite name="Suite" thread-count="5" parallel="tests">

<!--parallel="tests" means below 2 tests runs parallely-->
<!--thread-count=5 means we will be having 5 processes running at the
 same time, so if we have 3 browsers runining at the same time, then what will
 happen first browser will go to first thread, then second browser will go in 
 second thread and third browser will go in first or second whichever completed first
 but more number of thread count will also lead to poor performance, because more number'
 of threads means more occupied space in the memory, so it is always preferred to use
 lesser number of threads
 
 Note: In case if we have large number of test cases like 100-150 then we should use 
 thread count upto 5 only not more than that(5 maximum) 
 we can also keep threadcount in classes also
 
 We can also use parallel at class level, if we want to run multiple classes parallely
 then we have to write <suite name="Suite" thread-count="5" parallel="classes">
	 
We can also use parallel at method level, if we want to run methods parallely then we can 
write 	 <suite name="Suite" thread-count="5" parallel="methods">
	
Note:But it is not advised to run classes or methods parallely because we have classes dependent
on each other as well as we may have methods also dependent on some other methods so there may be 
conflict which results in failing of test cases
